# Python Word Guessing Game

Python is a powerful multi-purpose programming language used by multiple giant companies. It has simple and easy-to-use syntax making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time. It is a high-level programming language, and its core design philosophy is all about code readability and syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in a few lines of code.

## Overview

This Python program implements a word-guessing game using the `random` module. The game is designed for beginners learning to code in Python and provides practice with strings, loops, and conditional statements (If, else).

### random module:

The `random` module provides functions for generating random numbers, selecting random elements from lists, tuples, or strings, and performing other random operations. We utilize the `random.choice()` method to select a random word from a predefined list of words for the word-guessing game.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. You'll be prompted to enter your name.
3. The program will choose a random word from a list of words.
4. Guess the characters of the word one by one.
5. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word.
6. If you guess all the characters correctly within the given number of attempts, you win. Otherwise, you lose.
